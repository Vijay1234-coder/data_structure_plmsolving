Sum(set1) - Sum(set2) = diff ---------- 1
Sum(set1) + Sum(set2) = Sum(arr) --------2

Add 1+2

Sum(set1) = diff + sum(arr)  // 2

if we find the sum(set1) count then its means eg
arr= 1,1,2,3

set1 = 1,1,2   sum=4
set2= 3        sum = 3

sum(set1)-sum(set2) =1

so if we find count of sets such that their sum is equal  ==  diff + sum(arr)  // 2   1+7//2=4

our problem reduced into find subsets in given set having sum equal to Sum1
