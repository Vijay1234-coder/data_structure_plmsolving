''' Coin Change Problem Maximum Number of ways
Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents,
 and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm}
 valued coins, how many ways can we make the change?
 The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.
Example:
for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3},
there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}.
 So output should be 4.'''   # we can interpret this problem into subset Sum count but difference only is here repetition possible

        t[i][0]=1
