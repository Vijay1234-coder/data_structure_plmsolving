Here after including (n-1)th index we have choice that we can include that element multiples time so we will keep checking to
full length

BUT once we reject that element then we ignore it
and will keep checking on left out elements

t[n][w]=max(val[n-1]+t[n][w-wt[n-1], t[n-1][w])
                       ^
                       |
                   [HERE SINCE WE ACCEPTED THAT ELEMENT SO WE CAN THAKE IT MULTIPLE TIMES SO WILL KEEP CHECKING CURENT LEN]
else:
t[n][w]=t[n-1][w] <---  see checking to remaining element
